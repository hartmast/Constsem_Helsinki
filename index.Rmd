## Previous research

> - frequency distribution of both constructions: findings differ considerably (Žuikin 1975; Brons-Albert 1982; Matzel & Ulvestad 1982; Thieroff 1992)
> - Matzel & Ulvestad (1982): comparison of *werden* + Inf. vs. futurate present regarding temporal vs. modal/epistemic readings
> - Hilpert (2008): distinctive collexeme analysis - futurate present prefers telic verbs like *kommen* ‘come’ and *finden* ‘find’; *werden* + Infinitive “exhibits a preference for continuative events that unfold spontaneously” (Hilpert 2008: 176)
> - Hacke (2009): *werden* + Inf. entails a different "perspectivation" of the proposition - distance between (time of) utterance and (time of) proposition
> - Gelhaus (1975): *werden* + Inf. adds "pathos" and "emotional weight" to the utterance

## Present study

- Which factors determine the choice of werden + Inf. vs. futurate present in contemporary German?

- Does the choice of *werden* + Inf. over the futurate present lead to differences in the interpretation of utterances?

---

## Corpus study

- database: DWDS core corpus of the 21st century
- search for future-related temporal adverbials like *morgen*, *bald*, etc. (search terms from Hilpert 2008)
- 5000 hits randomly selected - 572 datapoints after manual deletion of false hits
- manually annotated for
  - **CONSTRUCTION**: Is the futurate present or the werden + Infinitive construction used in the sentence?
  - **NEGATION**: Is the proposition negated?
  - **CLAUSE**: Does the construction occur in a main clause or a subordinate clause?
  - **VOICE**: Is the sentence in which the construction occurs framed in the active or in the passive voice?
  - **TEMPORAL DISTANCE**: Proximity of the event, if it can be inferred from the temporal adverbial
  - **VERB LEMMA**: The lemma of the full verb.

---

## Corpus Study: Method

> - Conditional inference trees and random forests (Tagliamonte & Baayen 2012, Schneider 2014, Levshina 2015)

> - Basic idea: recursive partitioning - algorithm identifies most influential predictor variable and makes a binary split in this variable; this is repeated until no significant predictors are left

> - p-values obtained via permutation: labels on the observed data points are randomly rearranged - if this doesn't make a difference for the model, the predictor probably isn't important; if it does, the predictor is considered influential.

> - random forests consist of many conditional inference trees and yield the importance measure for every variable in the model averaged over many conditional trees (Levshina 2015: 292)

## Interim conclusion: Corpus study

- TEMPORAL DISTANCE seems to make a difference: *werden* + Inf. preferred over futurate present when the sentence relates to the more distant future

- CLAUSE and VOICE as important formal predictors

- however: results are very preliminary at this point!

---

## Corpus study

- near vs. distant future

- near: up to 1 year or indefinite adverbials referring to the near future, e.g. *bald*, *demnächst*

- distant: > 1 year, indefinite adverbials referring to more distant future, e.g. *in ferner Zukunft*

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
table1 <- tibble::tribble(
  ~'', ~near, ~distant, ~indefinite,
                                 "futurate present", "123",    "102",        "97",
                              "werden + Infinitive",  "60",     "96",        "94"
  )

require(knitr)
require(kableExtra)
kable_styling(
              kable(table1, digits = 3, row.names = FALSE, align = "c",
              caption = NULL, format = "html"),
        bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
        position = "center", full_width = FALSE) 

```

## Experimental study

- inspired by experimental approaches to progressive vs. non-progressive framing in Dutch and German (Flecken & Gerwien 2013, Hartmann 2016)

- designed with *jsPsych* (de Leeuw 2016)

- focus on the construal of temporal distance

---

## Experimental study: Results

- 94 volunteer participants (48 f, 38 m, 8 NA) 

- 17 participants had to be excluded (16 did not move the slider, 1 did not state German as their native language)

- analysis using mixed-effects modeling

---

## Experimental study: Results

- data were log-transformed and *z*-scored

## Experimental study: Results

- Model definition: distance_estimate ~  adverbial + framing + (1 | subject) + (1 | proposition)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

my_tbl <- tibble::tribble(
                       ~'', ~Estimate, ~'Std. Error', ~df, ~'t-value',            ~'Pr(>|t|)',
            "(Intercept)",     -0.63,        0.17,  12,    -3.66,    "0.0032**",
         "adv: demnächst",     -0.16,        0.24,  12,    -0.68,      "0.5109",
  "adv: in naher Zukunft",      0.85,        0.24,  12,     3.52,    "0.0043**",
       "adv: eines Tages",      1.75,        0.24,  12,     7.15, "1.20E-05***",
          "framing: werden",      0.05,        0.03, 914,      1.5,      "0.1351"
  )

require(knitr)
require(kableExtra)
kable_styling(
              kable(my_tbl, digits = 3, row.names = FALSE, align = "c",
              caption = NULL, format = "html"),
        bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
        position = "center", full_width = FALSE) 


```

## Conclusion

- *werden* + Infinitive and futurate present can be used exchangably to a considerable extent

- In language production, there seems to be a slight preference for *werden* + Inf. when referring to distant-future events

- In language comprehension, the use of *werden* + Infinitive does not seem to entail a difference in event construal (at least in the presence of a temporal adverbial)

---

## Outlook

- Both studies presented here limited to future-related utterances **with temporal adverbial**

- results can help understand important aspects of the semantics of both constructions - but for a fuller understanding, follow-up studies are needed

- follow-up corpus studies should take data **without** temporal adverbials into account and add the presence or absence of temporal adverbials as a further predictor

- follow-up experimental studies should use a more balanced set of propositions in their stimuli sentences

- also, a cross-linguistic approach seems desirable
